Summary:
This analysis shows there is a high demand for short term rentals by males. Most commonly in the early evening on Thursday. This information can be used and sold to nearby businesses so they can better take advantage of the demographic in the area at certain times of day. Below are the areas that have the top five highest starting and ending points. This can help businesses even further with aimed marketing.
